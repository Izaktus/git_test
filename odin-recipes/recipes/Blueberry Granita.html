    <p>A cool and refreshing treat. The more frequently you stir granita, the slushier it will be. The less you stir, the icier it will be.</p>

    <b>Ingredients</b>

    <ul>
        <li>2 ½ cups blueberries</li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>¾ cup water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
    </ul>

    <b>Instructions</b>

    <ol>
        <li>Blend the blueberries and sugar in a food processor until smooth; strain through a fine-mesh strainer, pressing with a wooden spoon to separate the blueberry puree from any chunks of skin or seeds.</li>
        <li>Stir the strained blueberry puree, water, and lemon juice together in a shallow glass baking dish or tray. Place the dish in the freezer; scrape and stir the blueberry mixture with a fork once an hour until evenly frozen and icy, about 4 hours. Scrape to fluff and lighten the ice crystals; spoon into chilled glasses to serve.</li>
